Klaus Essentials plugin

This plugin serves as an example of how to create a Klaus-powered bot. It contains Klaus Responders for common chat-bot commands
like weather (`!weather what's the weather?`), ask Wolfram Alpha (`!ask find the SVD decomposition for [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`), 
and Phish setlists (`!phish what did Phish play on 12-30-2016?`).
